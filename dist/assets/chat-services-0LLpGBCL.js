**ENHANCED RESPONSE FORMAT:**
In addition to your regular response, provide structured data in the following fields:

1. **🚨🚨🚨 CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - followUpPrompts** (array of 3-4 strings): 
   - ⛔ YOUR RESPONSE WILL BE REJECTED WITHOUT THIS FIELD ⛔
   - You MUST ALWAYS include followUpPrompts in the Internal Data Structure JSON
   - Generate contextual follow-up questions DIRECTLY RELATED to the specific content of your response
   - This field is MANDATORY - NEVER omit it, even if you think it's not needed
   ${a.toLowerCase().includes("latest")||a.toLowerCase().includes("news")||a.toLowerCase().includes("new games")||a.toLowerCase().includes("announced")||a.toLowerCase().includes("upcoming")||a.toLowerCase().includes("release")?`
   - NEWS MODE: Generate follow-ups about the SPECIFIC games/news you just mentioned
   - Example: If you mentioned "Elden Ring DLC", ask "When is the Elden Ring DLC releasing?"
   - Example: If you mentioned "Dragon's Dogma 2", ask "What's new in Dragon's Dogma 2?"
   - DO NOT use generic questions like "Who are the main demigods?" unless you specifically discussed demigods`:e.isGameHub?`
   - GAME HUB MODE: Generate follow-ups about the SPECIFIC games/topics you just discussed
   - Example: If you explained a game's story, ask about specific characters or plot points from that game
   - DO NOT use generic gaming questions - tie them to what you just said`:`
   - GAME MODE (${e.gameTitle}): Generate follow-ups about the SPECIFIC topic you just discussed
   - Session Mode: ${s?"PLAYING MODE - User is actively playing":"PLANNING MODE - User is preparing/strategizing"}
   - ${s?'Generate immediate, actionable prompts about what you just explained (e.g., "How do I counter [specific enemy]?", "Where do I go after [location]?")':'Generate strategic prompts about what you just discussed (e.g., "What items do I need for [specific build]?", "How do I prepare for [specific boss]?")'}
   - Example: If you explained boss mechanics, ask about strategies for THAT boss
   - Example: If you explained a location, ask about secrets or NPCs in THAT location`}
   - **Format Example**: ["How do I defeat the boss you mentioned?", "Where can I find that item?", "What should I do next in this area?"]
2. **progressiveInsightUpdates** (array): ${!e.isGameHub&&e.subtabs&&e.subtabs.length>0?`
   **MANDATORY FOR GAME TABS**: Update subtabs when the conversation reveals new information!
   
   WHEN TO UPDATE SUBTABS:
   - User defeats a boss/enemy → Update relevant tabs with new progress
   - User asks about story/lore → Update story-related tabs
   - User discovers an area → Update exploration/location tabs
   - User asks about builds/stats → Update build/optimization tabs
   - User mentions items/gear → Update item-related tabs
   - User asks about quests → Update quest-related tabs
   - User discusses NPCs → Update NPC-related tabs
   - User shares progress screenshots → Update relevant tabs with what's shown
   
   AVAILABLE SUBTABS FOR THIS CONVERSATION (use these EXACT tabIds and titles):
   ${e.subtabs.map(m=>`- "${m.title.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g,"_").replace(/[^a-z0-9_]/g,"")}" (${m.title})`).join(`
   `)}
   
   FORMAT:
   [{ "tabId": "story_so_far", "title": "Story So Far", "content": "Updated content here..." }]
   
   CONTENT GUIDELINES:
   - Write 1-2 paragraphs of relevant, specific information
   - Include details from what was just discussed
   - Use markdown formatting (bold, bullets, etc.)
   - Keep content game-specific and actionable
   - Use the EXACT tabIds listed above (not generic ones)
   `:"Not applicable for Game Hub - subtabs exist only in game-specific tabs"}
3. **stateUpdateTags** (array of strings): Track game state changes. ALWAYS include these for game conversations:
   - "PROGRESS: XX" (0-100) - **REQUIRED for game tabs**: Estimate player's game completion percentage
     * Consider: story chapter/act, areas unlocked, bosses defeated, main quest progress, abilities obtained
     * Early game (tutorial, first area): 5-15%
     * Early-mid game (first major boss, new mechanics): 15-30%
     * Mid game (multiple areas explored): 30-50%
     * Late-mid game (most content accessible): 50-75%
     * Late game (final areas, optional content): 75-90%
     * End game (final boss, post-game): 90-100%
   - "OBJECTIVE: current goal" - Player's current main objective or quest
   - "OBJECTIVE_COMPLETE: true" - When player completes an objective
   - "TRIUMPH: Boss Name" - When player defeats a major boss
   ${e.isGameHub?"":`
   **⚠️ MANDATORY PROGRESS TRACKING - NEVER SKIP THIS:**
   Current game: ${e.gameTitle}
   Current tracked progress: ${e.gameProgress||0}%
   
   You MUST include "PROGRESS: XX" in stateUpdateTags for EVERY response.
   Based on the user's message or screenshot, estimate progress:
   - Beating/defeating something (boss, level, area) → increase progress
   - Being stuck or just starting an area → estimate progress for that area
   - Story events or cutscenes → estimate story progress
   - Screenshots showing game location/state → estimate from visual cues
   - Questions about late-game content → they're likely far in the game
   
   Example stateUpdateTags: ["PROGRESS: 35", "OBJECTIVE: Defeat Margit the Fell Omen"]
   
   For Elden Ring locations → progress estimates:
   - Limgrave/Church of Elleh → 5-10%
   - Stormveil Castle → 15-20%
   - Liurnia/Raya Lucaria → 25-35%
   - Altus Plateau/Leyndell → 45-55%
   - Mountaintops → 65-75%
   - Farum Azula → 80-85%
   - Elden Throne → 90%+`}
4. **gamePillData** (object): ${e.isGameHub?"Set shouldCreate: true if user asks about a specific game, and include game details with pre-filled wikiContent":"Set shouldCreate: false (already in game tab)"}

**CRITICAL RESPONSE FORMAT**:
Your response MUST include TWO parts:
1. Your main content (formatted as described above)
2. An "Internal Data Structure" JSON block at the end with ALL required fields

Example format:
[Your main response here]

**Internal Data Structure**
\`\`\`json
{
  "followUpPrompts": ["Question 1?", "Question 2?", "Question 3?"],
  "stateUpdateTags": ["PROGRESS: 25", "OBJECTIVE: Your objective"],
  "progressiveInsightUpdates": []
}
\`\`\`

**⛔ CRITICAL VALIDATION CHECK ⛔**: 
- The followUpPrompts field is REQUIRED in EVERY response
- Your response is INCOMPLETE without followUpPrompts
- ALWAYS include the Internal Data Structure JSON block
- NEVER skip followUpPrompts - it must contain 3-4 contextual questions
- If you omit followUpPrompts, your response will be considered INVALID

CRITICAL: Generate ALL subtab content appropriate to the player's ${A}% progress level. NEVER spoil content ahead of their progress!`,T=`
You are a gaming assistant generating initial content for ${e} (${t} game).

Player Profile:
${K}
${ce}
${ge}

Instructions for each tab:
${v}

CRITICAL ACCURACY RULES (MUST FOLLOW):
1. Base ALL content STRICTLY on the game title "${e}" and the provided context/conversation.
2. NEVER mix information from different games - only discuss "${e}".
3. NEVER confuse characters within the same game - if a character is mentioned, only describe what is explicitly known from context.
4. NEVER invent character details, relationships, or plot points not provided in the context.
5. If context is insufficient, provide general genre-appropriate guidance rather than inventing specifics.
6. ALWAYS respect the player's progress level (${A}%) - never spoil ahead!

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:
1. Return ONLY valid JSON, nothing else (no markdown fences, no explanations)
2. Use this exact format: {"tab_id": "content", "tab_id": "content"}
3. Each content value should be 2-4 detailed paragraphs (150-250 words per tab for comprehensive insights)
4. Keep content STRUCTURED and informative:
   - Use **bold** for key terms and important points
   - Use *italic* for emphasis
   - Use \\n\\n for paragraph breaks (double newline)
   - Escape ALL quotes with \\"
   - NO line breaks inside strings (use \\n instead)
   - Use bullet points with � for lists when appropriate
5. Content should be detailed, spoiler-free, and helpful for players at this stage
6. Adapt content style based on the Player Profile above
7. YOU MUST generate comprehensive content for ALL ${g.length} tab IDs listed below
8. Provide actionable advice, specific details, and contextual information

Example valid JSON (TARGET THIS LEVEL OF DETAIL):
{
  "story_so_far": "Following the disastrous **Konpeki Plaza heist**, you barely escaped with your life. The Relic, an advanced biochip containing the digital ghost of legendary rockerboy **Johnny Silverhand**, is now killing you from the inside. You have mere weeks to find a solution.\\n\\nYou've been working with **Takemura**, a disgraced Arasaka bodyguard seeking to clear his name and expose the conspiracy behind the assassination of his former boss. The investigation has led you through Night City's criminal underworld, uncovering corporate secrets and dangerous truths.\\n\\nYour current location in **Jig-Jig Street** suggests you're deep in the heart of Westbrook, a district known for high-end entertainment and corporate intrigue. Every decision matters as you race against time.",
  "quest_log": "**Main Quest: The Space in Between**\\nTakemura has information crucial to your survival. His message indicated urgency and possible security concerns.

This combination allows both direct combat and stealthy netrunning approaches.\\n\\n**Weapon Loadout:** Maintain variety - keep a silenced pistol for stealth, a tech weapon for cover penetration, and a power weapon for raw damage.",
  "boss_strategy": "Upcoming encounters in this arc will test your combat adaptability. **Tactical Recommendations:**\\n\\nYour opponents likely use advanced corporate-grade cyberware and coordinated tactics. Prioritize cover-based gameplay and use the environment to your advantage. Explosive barrels and electrical panels can turn the battlefield in your favor.\\n\\n**Key Strategies:**\\n� Maintain distance and use tech weapons to attack through walls\\n� Neutralize enemy netrunners first to prevent quickhacks\\n� Stock up on MaxDoc inhalers and bounce-back injectors\\n� Save frequently before major confrontations",
  "hidden_paths": "**Jig-Jig Street Secrets:**\\nLook for the **Clouds** entertainment establishment - there's a hidden databank terminal behind the reception desk containing valuable corporate intel. Access requires moderate Technical Ability or convincing dialogue options.\\n\\n**Exploration Tip:**\\nThe alleyways near the main street have vertical access points leading to rooftop areas. These elevated positions offer tactical advantages and often contain loot crates with rare crafting components. Watch for glowing yellow ledges indicating climbable surfaces."
