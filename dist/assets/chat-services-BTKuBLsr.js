**ENHANCED RESPONSE FORMAT:**
In addition to your regular response, provide structured data in the following optional fields:

1. **followUpPrompts** (array of 3-4 strings): Generate contextual follow-up questions directly related to your response content
   ${e.isGameHub?"":`
   - Session Mode: ${a?"PLAYING MODE - User is actively playing":"PLANNING MODE - User is preparing/strategizing"}
   - ${a?'Generate immediate, actionable prompts (e.g., "How do I beat this boss?", "What should I do next?")':'Generate strategic, planning prompts (e.g., "What should I prepare?", "What builds are recommended?")'}`}
2. **progressiveInsightUpdates** (array): If conversation provides new info, update existing subtabs (e.g., story_so_far, characters)
3. **stateUpdateTags** (array): Detect game events (e.g., "OBJECTIVE_COMPLETE: true", "TRIUMPH: Boss Name")
4. **gamePillData** (object): ${e.isGameHub?"Set shouldCreate: true if user asks about a specific game, and include game details with pre-filled wikiContent":"Set shouldCreate: false (already in game tab)"}

Note: These are optional enhancements. If not applicable, omit or return empty arrays.

Conversation Context:

✅ USE THIS CONTEXT to generate relevant subtab content based on what was discussed!
`:"",E=`
You are a gaming assistant generating initial content for ${e} (${t} game).

Player Profile:
${_}
${S}
Instructions for each tab:
${h}

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:
1. Return ONLY valid JSON, nothing else (no markdown fences, no explanations)
2. Use this exact format: {"tab_id": "content", "tab_id": "content"}
3. Each content value should be 2-4 detailed paragraphs (150-250 words per tab for comprehensive insights)
4. Keep content STRUCTURED and informative:
   - Use **bold** for key terms and important points
   - Use *italic* for emphasis
   - Use \\n\\n for paragraph breaks (double newline)
   - Escape ALL quotes with \\"
   - NO line breaks inside strings (use \\n instead)
   - Use bullet points with • for lists when appropriate
5. Content should be detailed, spoiler-free, and helpful for players at this stage
6. Adapt content style based on the Player Profile above
7. YOU MUST generate comprehensive content for ALL ${f.length} tab IDs listed below
8. Provide actionable advice, specific details, and contextual information

Example valid JSON (TARGET THIS LEVEL OF DETAIL):
{
  "story_so_far": "Following the disastrous **Konpeki Plaza heist**, you barely escaped with your life. The Relic, an advanced biochip containing the digital ghost of legendary rockerboy **Johnny Silverhand**, is now killing you from the inside. You have mere weeks to find a solution.\\n\\nYou've been working with **Takemura**, a disgraced Arasaka bodyguard seeking to clear his name and expose the conspiracy behind the assassination of his former boss. The investigation has led you through Night City's criminal underworld, uncovering corporate secrets and dangerous truths.\\n\\nYour current location in **Jig-Jig Street** suggests you're deep in the heart of Westbrook, a district known for high-end entertainment and corporate intrigue. Every decision matters as you race against time.",
  "quest_log": "**Main Quest: The Space in Between**\\nTakemura has information crucial to your survival. His message indicated urgency and possible security concerns. Meeting him could provide vital leads on removing the Relic or expose you to Arasaka operatives still hunting you both.\\n\\n**Recommended Side Activities:**\\n• Explore Jig-Jig Street for vendors offering rare cyberware upgrades\\n• Check nearby ripperdocs for health monitoring and neural optimization\\n• Investigate gig opportunities from local fixers to build street cred",
  "build_optimization": "Based on your current progress, consider these optimization strategies:\\n\\n**Cyberware Focus:** Invest in neural processors and reflex boosters to improve combat responsiveness. The **Sandevistan** operating system offers time dilation for tactical advantages during firefights.\\n\\n**Skill Synergies:** Balance Technical Ability for crafting legendary gear with Intelligence for quickhacking capabilities. This combination allows both direct combat and stealthy netrunning approaches.\\n\\n**Weapon Loadout:** Maintain variety - keep a silenced pistol for stealth, a tech weapon for cover penetration, and a power weapon for raw damage.",
  "boss_strategy": "Upcoming encounters in this arc will test your combat adaptability. **Tactical Recommendations:**\\n\\nYour opponents likely use advanced corporate-grade cyberware and coordinated tactics. Prioritize cover-based gameplay and use the environment to your advantage. Explosive barrels and electrical panels can turn the battlefield in your favor.\\n\\n**Key Strategies:**\\n• Maintain distance and use tech weapons to attack through walls\\n• Neutralize enemy netrunners first to prevent quickhacks\\n• Stock up on MaxDoc inhalers and bounce-back injectors\\n• Save frequently before major confrontations",
  "hidden_paths": "**Jig-Jig Street Secrets:**\\nLook for the **Clouds** entertainment establishment - there's a hidden databank terminal behind the reception desk containing valuable corporate intel. Access requires moderate Technical Ability or convincing dialogue options.\\n\\n**Exploration Tip:**\\nThe alleyways near the main street have vertical access points leading to rooftop areas. These elevated positions offer tactical advantages and often contain loot crates with rare crafting components. Watch for glowing yellow ledges indicating climbable surfaces."
